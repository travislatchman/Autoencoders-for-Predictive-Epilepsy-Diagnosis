# Autoencoders-for-Predictive-Epilepsy-Diagnosis

## Representation Learning with Autoencoders for Predictive Epilepsy Diagnosis Models

**Brief Description:** This project focused on utilizing representation learning with autoencoders to build predictive models for epilepsy diagnosis.

### Implementation (see notebook for each task):
* Replicated an auto-encoder from a research paper.
* Trained auto-encoders for unsupervised representation learning.
* Leveraged the encoder for supervised learning by attaching a classifier.
* Visualized the reconstructed signals.
* Explored designing bottlenecks in an auto-encoder.
